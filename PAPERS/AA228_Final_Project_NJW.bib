	abstract = {SummaryA brief review of numerical models of thunderstorms is presented. The attempts of modeling these clouds have to deal with an extremely broad range of microphysical and dynamic processes. Basic concepts of thunderstorm modeling, 1-D, 2-D and 3-D models are considered. Particular attention is given to the basic equations and to the capability of these models to predict characteristics of the tunderstorms. A brief treatment is also given of hail growth in thunderstorm models.},

To date, few programs are available to solve SDP/MDP. We present MDPtoolbox, a multi-platform set of functions to solve Markov decision problems (MATLAB, GNU Octave, Scilab and R). MDPtoolbox provides state-of-the-art and ready to use algorithms to solve a wide range of MDPs. MDPtoolbox is easy to use, freely available and has been continuously improved since 2004. We illustrate how to use MDPtoolbox on a dynamic reserve design problem.},

	abstract = {Convective storms exist under a wide variety of conditions and evolve in an equally wide variety of ways. As the understanding of convective phenomena has increased, so has appreciation of their complexity. Storm behavior is inherently dependent on the environment in which the storm grows, including thermodynamic stability, vertical wind profiles, and mesoscale forcing influences. To the extent that the important prestorm conditions can be identified (through rawinsonde ascents, surface observations, satellites, vertical profilers, etc.), current knowledge provides valuable guidance on how convection will evolve in a given environment. For example, inferences can be made about storm motion, longevity, and potential severity. Because of the complexity of the problem, however, the knowledge of storm dynamics to date is most applicable to relatively isolated convective events, i.e., individual thunderstorm cells, small groups of cells, or some very simple squall lines. To the extent that larger scale systems such as Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs) are made up of individual convective cells, this knowledge of the properties of isolated convection is still very useful. But as interactions among cells, along with mesoscale and synoptic-scale influences, become important, any inferences regarding storm behavior are made with less certainty.},

The result is a long-lived supercell storm. These storms are the most intense type of thunderstorm. In the central United States, supercells typically have a broad, intense updraft that enters from the southeast and brings moist surface air into the storm. The updraft rises, rotates counterclockwise, and exits to the east, forming an anvil. Updraft speeds in supercell storms can exceed 40 metres (130 feet) per second and are capable of suspending hailstones as large as grapefruit. Supercells can},
